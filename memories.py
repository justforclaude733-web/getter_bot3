"""
Player "memories" (milestones) and favorite-character affinity.

The goal: make the bot feel like it's adapting to each player's taste.
Every time a player checks a card, or organically obtains one (claims a
spawn with /get, receives a /gift, or buys on the Market), this module:

  1. Nudges an affinity score for that specific character up a little.
     Once a night (see run_nightly_engagement_loop), whichever character
     has the highest score gets cached as that player's "favorite" -
     get_favorite_character() reads that cache. Recomputing nightly
     instead of live keeps it feeling like a stable answer ("this is
     currently my favorite") rather than flipping mid-conversation.

  2. Checks whether the acquisition just crossed a one-time milestone:
       - first-ever card of a rarity tier
       - first-ever copy of that specific character
       - a round-number cumulative count of that rarity (10th, 100th...)
       - a round-number cumulative collection size (50th card ever, ...)
     Milestones are lifetime counters - selling a card later doesn't
     undo having reached 100 Legendaries once. They're also logged to
     user_memories with a timestamp, which is what /memories reads back.

record_acquisition() returns a list of ready-to-send HTML messages,
voiced as the player's favorite character reacting to the news. The
caller (bot.py for /get and /gift, api_server.py for Market buys) is
responsible for actually delivering them (DM, since this is meant to
feel like a personal note, not a group announcement).

run_nightly_engagement_loop() is meant to run once, forever, in a
background thread (see bot.py) - each pass it recomputes every player's
cached favorite and checks whether today is anyone's randomly-assigned
monthly gift day.
